                <h4>Laini Taylor</h4>
                <p>Around the world, black hand prints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.<br><br>
                        In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grows dangerously low.<br><br>
                        And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherworldly war.<br><br>
                        Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair actually grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out. <br><br>
                        When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</p>

          <p>Once upon a time, a fantasy book came unto the young adult world and set it aflame. 
            Long-time fans of the author swooned. Mainstream publications wrote cryptic but positive impressions. 
            And many readers declared that the book was leaps and bounds above all other young adult literature previously published. <br> 
            It's always a little tricky reading a book that arrives with a crazy amount of hype, even one that's not accompanied by the lavish praise that 
            has been heaped upon this one, as the pressure to love it can be pretty intense. The story of a tattooed, blue-haired orphaned teenager named 
            Karou caught up in an ancient war between angels and demons sounded amazing, however, and I was completely drawn in from the very first page. 
            Karou is a young art student living in Prague, except that the fantastic figures she draws are actually of demons that she has known. She meets 
            them in her strange teeth-collecting errands whenever she's summoned by Brimstone, a beast who has been a father figure to her as long as she can remember. </p>

            <p>I don't think words can properly describe how much I adored SHADOW & BONE. The characters, 
              the world-building...it completely blew me away. There were moments when I was so stunned by 
              the beauty and the brilliance that I had to stop reading. I never wanted this book to end.
              <br>
              This is the best YA fantasy novel I've read since SABRIEL or THE GOLDEN COMPASS. </p>

            <p>Caleana Sardothien, young woman assassin, is betrayed and sentenced to the salt mines of Endovier. 
              After a year, however, she is given an opportunity: If she wins a contest to become the king's champion, 
              she will be granted a four-year contract, working as an assassin for the empire she hates, at the end of 
              which time she will be freed. After reading the premise of the book, I thought, "Sign me up!" After the 
              first chapter, I knew I was in good hands. This book has plenty of mystery, magic, humor and romance -- 
              a perfect brew for fans of good YA fantasy. If you liked Graceling, Grave Mercy, Shadow and Bone or other 
              fantasies featuring strong female protagonists with scary good skills, I think you'll enjoy this quite a lot. 
              And it's the first of a series! </p>

            <p>The book was badassy greatly thrilly epic.I enjoyed every bit of it. 
              It was also confusing because when I think about the characters,they are only fifteen 
              and they are like Einstein smart and Bruce Lee strong,and when I was their age I didn't 
              even know how to boil an egg.Way to build my self-esteem.But come on that's why I am a 
              reader.To read about things that seem so unbelievable to achieve,but in the end proving 
              that everything is possible.That's why I love reading. </p>
