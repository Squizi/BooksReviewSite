                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br><br>
                  It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br><br>
                  Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.<br><br>
                  This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br><br>
                  The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

          <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, 
            by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, 
            you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet 
            tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. </p>

            <p>I don't think words can properly describe how much I adored this book. The characters, 
              the setting...it completely blew me away. There were moments when I was so stunned by 
              the beauty and the brilliance that I had to stop reading. I never wanted this book to end. </p>

            <p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
              as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many 
              desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
              and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
              have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>

            <p>The book was badassy greatly thrilly epic.I enjoyed every bit of it. 
              It was also confusing because when I think about the characters,they are only fifteen 
              and they are like Einstein smart and Bruce Lee strong,and when I was their age I didn't 
              even know how to boil an egg. Way to build my self-esteem.But come on that's why I am a 
              reader.To read about things that seem so unbelievable to achieve,but in the end proving 
              that everything is possible.That's why I love reading. </p>
